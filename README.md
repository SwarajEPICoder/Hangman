Simple Hangman Project

<p>This is a simple command line Hangman project with simple graphics(which I put a lot of hard work into).</p>

About the files:

  <li>helpers.py - Some utility funtions, variable and a list of the stick figures of hangman.</li>
  <li>hangman.py - The main game loop</li>
  <li>main.py - To run the game (Just to make it fancy)</li>
</ol>
